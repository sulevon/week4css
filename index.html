            <p class="specialtext">In my free time I'm either playing games or making music. Minecraft is a game that takes up a lot of my time due to its long lasting enjoyment for me.
                <br>I like writing stories, recording silly skits or short films in games, anything that could get someone immersed. I also like playing with friends more than anything.
                <br>I also love to sit around and listen to music and sometimes sing, yes even in public.
